# Citi Bike Data Analysis (Jan - June 2020)

#### **[Citi Bike Tableau Visualization Link](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikeVisualization_16337529005030/CitiBikeDataVisualizationJan-June2020?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

For my Tableau assignment, I have selected Citi Bike data from January 2020 till June 2020.

I decided to focus on this set of data to highlight the phenomenon “**The Great Bicycle Boom of 2020**”. The Pandemic brought about a dramatic increase in the rise of biking, which led more and more people to start using bikes as compared to public transport. This particular phenomenon was well documented as “**The Great Bike Boom of 2020**”.

The effects of this phenomenon were seen in the usage of Citi Bikes over the mentioned 6 months.

**Start Station & End Station Dashboards -** 

I have two dashboards in my analysis that focus on the 10 most active Start and End stations. For each dashboard, you can see a map visualization with the most active stations highlighted in color and a horizontal bar graph depicting the number of rides for each station. Each location pin on the map has a popup layer that displays the station’s name and the number of rides that originated/ended at that station. I’ve used red and blue color schemes as these are the major colors in the Citi Bike logo.

**The Great Bike Boom of 2020 -** 

In my next visualization, I’ve displayed the number of rides for each top 10 station over the 6 months. This is a dual-axis visualization where the bar graph displays the number of rides for each station, and the line graph shows the trend. I’ve marked March, April & May month in red color on the line graph to differentiate.

I’ve also annotated two key dates concerning Pandemic and how the number of rides was affected because of them. To support the phenomenon of “The Great Bike Boom of 2020”, I’ve created a dashboard from April till June.

I’ve added an average line for each of these months. You can see the average number of rides for April was close to 23k, for May it was approx. 48k, and for June it was 64k that is three times April’s data.

I’ve also mentioned few key dates in each month when the number of rides increased staggeringly. These two visualizations support the mentioned phenomenon.

**User base Composition based on gender, age, and user types** - 

The “User Base Composition” visualization displays a stacked bar graph that gives a breakdown of Subscriber and Customer data. It is observed that after April, there was a massive increase in both Subscriber and Customer user types which supports the phenomenon.

The next visualization is also a stacked bar graph that displays a breakdown of users based on gender and age. It is observed that the most frequent age group to use Citi Bikes are from 26-35 followed by 36-50. It is also observed that Male constitutes more than 60% in all age groups except in 51-60 where the gender of a large population is unknown.

**Bike Usage** - 

Bike usage visualization is a line graph that displays the number of hours (trip duration) each bike has been used for each month. There’s a slider to select a particular Bike Id and see its usage over time.

This interactive visualization is helpful from the maintenance point of view. It helps in prioritizing which bike needs maintenance based on the number of hours it has been used in a particular month.
